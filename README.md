# üè• Clinic Management System

## üìå Project Overview

This project implements a *relational database system* to manage clinic operations, including *patients, **appointments, **doctors, **clinics, and **departments*.
It demonstrates *SQL database design, **data population, **queries, and **update triggers* to simulate real-world healthcare management.

---

## üîç Project Goals

* Design and implement a *normalized relational database* for clinical operations.
* Enable efficient *CRUD* operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
* Write *practical SQL queries* for healthcare use cases.
* Maintain *data integrity* using relationships and constraints.

---

## üóÇ Database Structure

*Entities & Attributes*

* *Department* ‚Äì DepartmentID, Name
* *Clinic* ‚Äì ClinicID, Name, Address, DepartmentID
* *Doctor* ‚Äì DoctorID, Name, Phone, Address, DepartmentID
* *Patient* ‚Äì PatientID, Name, Phone, Address, BirthDate, Job
* *Appointment* ‚Äì AppointmentID, Date, PatientID, DoctorID, StartTime, EndTime, Cost, Status, Diagnosis

---

## üîó Relationships

* One *Department* ‚Üí Many *Clinics*
* One *Department* ‚Üí Many *Doctors*
* One *Clinic* ‚Üí One *Department*
* One *Doctor* ‚Üí Many *Appointments*
* One *Patient* ‚Üí Many *Appointments*

---

## üìÇ Data Overview

*Sample Data Includes:*

* *10 Departments* (e.g., Cardiology, Neurology, Pediatrics, Oncology).
* *10 Clinics* linked to departments.
* *10 Doctors* assigned to departments.
* *10 Patients* with personal details.
* *10 Appointments* with diagnosis, cost, and status.

## üß™ Example SQL Queries

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Patients diagnosed with Fatty liver in the last year

sql
SELECT Name
FROM Patient
WHERE PatientID IN (
    SELECT PatientID
    FROM Appointment
    WHERE Diagnosis = 'Fatty liver' 
      AND Date >= DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 1 YEAR)
);


### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Addresses of Cardiology clinics

sql
SELECT Clinic.Address
FROM Clinic
JOIN Department ON Clinic.DepartmentID = Department.DepartmentID
WHERE Department.Name = 'Cardiology';


### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Total money paid by patient 12527 in the last 3 years

sql
SELECT SUM(Cost) AS TotalPaid
FROM Appointment
WHERE PatientID = 12527 
  AND Date >= DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 3 YEAR);


### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Update patient contact information

sql
UPDATE Patient
SET Address = 'New Address', PhoneNumber = 'New PhoneNumber'
WHERE PatientID = 12530;


---

---

## ‚öô Setup Instructions

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create the database and tables

sql
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS Clinic_System;
CREATE DATABASE Clinic_System;
USE Clinic_System;

-- Create tables (Department, Clinic, Doctor, Patient, Appointment)
-- Add foreign keys and constraints


### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Populate with sample data

sql
INSERT INTO Department VALUES
(1, 'Cardiology'), (2, 'Neurology'), (3, 'Dermatology'), ...;


### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Run queries

Test the provided *SELECT, **UPDATE, and **JOIN* queries.

---

## üìò Learning Outcomes

* Designing a *fully relational database* with multiple relationships.
* Writing *complex SQL queries* with joins, subqueries, and aggregates.
* Using *foreign keys* to ensure data integrity.
* Populating a database with realistic healthcare data.

## üèÅ Conclusion

The Clinic Management System demonstrates how a well-designed relational database can simplify medical data management.
By combining structured schema design, meaningful relationships, and practical SQL queries, this project offers a scalable solution for real-world clinic operations.
Future work could integrate a *web-based interface* and *authentication system* to make it production-ready.
